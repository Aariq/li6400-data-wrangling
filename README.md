# li6400-data-wrangling
the LI6400 portable photosynthesis meter exports data as a series of poorly formatted .xls files.  If you've used "add remark" to indicate sample ID, these are shown as rows, not a separate column. This script extracts relevant data, and moves the sample ID information from remarks into a column.
